### Low Priority
- None

## Technical Debt

- None (fresh project)

## Performance Metrics

### Backend (Not Measured Yet)
- API response time: TBD
- Parser processing: TBD
- Export generation: TBD

### Frontend (Not Built Yet)
- Load time: TBD
- First contentful paint: TBD
- Time to interactive: TBD

## Resource Usage (Docker)

### Estimated (Not Running Yet)
- MongoDB: ~200MB RAM
- Each microservice: ~50-100MB RAM
- Total estimated: ~1GB RAM

## Next 3 Priorities

1. **Build Frontend Foundation**
   - Vite + React setup
   - Tailwind CSS configuration
   - Basic routing structure

2. **Authentication UI**
   - Login page
   - Register page
   - Protected routes

3. **Dashboard**
   - Projects list
   - Create new project
   - Project cards

## Blockers

- None currently

## Risks

### Low Risk
- Frontend framework choices are proven
- Backend architecture is solid
- Dependencies are stable

### Medium Risk
- Performance with large documents
- Complex MDX parsing edge cases

### High Risk
- None identified

## Team Notes

- Single developer (Mihir)
- AI-assisted development
- Focus on MVP first, then iterate

## Timeline

### Week 1 (Current)
- ‚úÖ Backend microservices
